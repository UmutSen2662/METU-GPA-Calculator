# METU GPA Calculator

[METU GPA Calculator](https://metugpacalculator.pythonanywhere.com/) is website I made using Flaks and HTMX. It is currently hosted on pythonanywhere. It is inspired by the [NCClife GPA calculator](https://ncclife.net/gpa-calculator).

## Course Names JSON

This file comes from my [web scraper](https://github.com/UmutSen2662/METU-NCC-Course-Scraper) made to scrape course codes from the METU NCC [catalog website](https://catalog.metu.edu.tr/).

## Roadmap

This was a passion project of mine and I am quite happy with the results so I plan to continue devoloping it further in the next 2 years that I am a student at METU.
